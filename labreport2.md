## Code Change 1
![Fix](Fix1.png)
- Installing VS code was easy, simply navigated to the VS code website and then installed the program.
- Attached is my VS code startup window.

# Code Change 2
![Fix2](Fix2.png)
- I am on MacOS so I did not have to install OpenSSH, but I did have to prepare my course-specific account for CSE 15L by resetting the password.
- I connected to the server through my local device with `ssh cs15lsp22akz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
- I had to answer some simple questions and ended up getting connected as shown in the screenshot above.

# Code Change 3
![Fix3](Fixx3.png)
- I began with trying out the command `cd ~`, which allows the user to change their working directory.
- I then tried out two commands `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp22/public/hello.txt ~/` and `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp22/public/hello.txt`, but my permission was denied.
- he first command allows the user to copy files or directories, while the second command allows the user to concatenate files.
- I also tried `ls` which is a command that lists files.
